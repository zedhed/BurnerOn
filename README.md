# BurnerOn
Software application used to create BurnerOn project on Hackster.io

I didn't write all this code myself, it was hacked together from code found in the following Avnet example projects:

https://github.com/Avnet/AvnetAzureSphereStarterKitReferenceDesign

https://github.com/Avnet/clickboard_demos

https://github.com/Avnet/clickmodules

https://github.com/CloudConnectKits/Azure_Sphere_SK_ADC_RTApp

A write up for the equipment I put together to use this code is posted here on Hackster.io:
